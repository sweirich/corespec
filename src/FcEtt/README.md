This repository must be built with Coq 8.13.

It requires MathComp (v1.12), and the 8.10 branch of
[metalib](https://github.com/plclub/metalib) to
install.  The former comes from opam, the latter from Github.  For full
installation instructions, see LIBRARIES.md.

To build the Coq, run `make coq`.

This work checks with Coq's native theory -- it includes no Axioms or other
extensions.

Note: sigs.v contains the definition of several Coq module types that allow us
to break the development into multiple pieces. These signatures use the
keyword "Axiom" to specify the expected results of the modules.  All of these
"Axioms" are proved in the development.

    Modules and Sigs:
     ext_wf     : ext_wf_sig
     ext_weak   : ext_weak_sig
     ext_subst  : ext_subst_sig
     ext_invert : ext_invert_sig
     fc_wf      : fc_wf_sig
     fc_weak    : fc_weak_sig
     fc_subst   : fc_subst_sig
     fc_unique  : fc_unique_sig
