This experimental branch (`sigma`) extends the ICFP 17 system with Sigma types. 
The pure icfp17 system is available at tag icfp17. The version of the 
system with roles is on the branch `stable`.

The prior development, corresponding to the ICFP 2017 paper, augmented with rules
for eta-equivalence, is available on the "master" branch.
